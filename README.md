# Brokkr
Brokkr is yet another little Vulkan framework written in C++ for Windows.

# Building
A Visual Studio solution is included under build/vs2015 to compile the library and all the samples with Visual Studio.
Remember to set the working directory to "../../../samples/bin/" in order to run the samples from within Visual Studio.
