# Brokkr
Brokkr is yet another little Vulkan framework written in C++ for Windows (Linux support is on the way). It's still under developement so there might be errors and features missing.

# Building
A Visual Studio solution is included under build/vs2015 to compile the library and all the samples with Visual Studio.
Remember to set working directory to "../../../samples/bin/" to run the samples from within Visual Studio.
